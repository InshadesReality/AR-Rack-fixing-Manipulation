# AR-Rackixing-Manipulation

Purchasing products for interior design always has a problem that the purchased products may not satisfy customers because they cannot put them in their place before buying. The purpose of this research is to study and develop an android application called “AR APP FOR RACK FIXING SYSTEM” .With the use of Augmented Reality technologies for rack fixing system, that will help customers visualize how racks are fixed and fit (to scale) in their places and also can provide details of products to support customer decision. This application is a prototype to find out factors affecting the racks fixing, room measurement and tracking of AR applications.

The aim of this project to create AR app for automatic rack fixing system .It helps them to measure room size, fix racks in room and enable them to calculate how many racks are needed and its cost. It helps customers to visualize the racks in their room before fixing it. It will make a major difference for the customers to use as a full project to make a full app in a business prespective to the checkout process.

By using this application we can increase or decrease the number of racks check out the product. In business perspective view, this acts as a complete product application.


** Prices are automatically added when we increase the number of racks. Finally, we can check out the product**.
